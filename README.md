# bookwires-orchestrator
Documentation orchestrator.
  
**Problem**
When going through many documentation projects on GitHub, metadata is often included in the Markdown as well. For me, this causes buzz and makes it less clear how to manage the product. Per library, an own setup is needed.  This should be replaced with a tool everyone already knows to orchestrate this process. 
 
**Final result**
HTML generation of Markdown.
 
**Recommendations**
A separate repository for documentation by default.
 
**Must-haves**
- Markdown files should only hold documentation (nice view on documentation per Markdown file)
- Ability for custom parsers
- Open-source
- Code-first
- Parsing logic, or metadata information should be code-first by default.
